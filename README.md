# SampleSequencer
An application for creating unique drum patterns. 

1. The first step is to select a drum hit from the library, upload a sound from your computer, or record a new sound using a microphone.

2. Once a sound is loaded in the sound is visualized and you are able to trim the audio clip by dragging on the audio wave. Also add some effects to the clip.

3. Next, you can send the sample to the sequencer by clicking the 'Sequence' button. Then you can schedule the sample for playback on any 16th note in the sequencer.
